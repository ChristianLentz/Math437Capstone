    "# Numerical Techniques for the Wave Equation\n",
    "## Math 437 Capstone Project, Fall 2023\n",
    "### Author: Christian Lentz\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project will be to investigate numerical techniques for approximating solutions to PDEs. We will use finite differences to build a simple model for the wave equation with randomized initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions. We include a total of four implementations of finite differences. This will motivate discussions and comparisons of other numerical techniques and thier implementations, particularly the Fourier spectral method. We include one (partially complete) implementation of the Fourier spectral method using the Fast Fourier Transform through SciPy's FFT package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by briefly discussing the wave equation, and move directly into a discussion of finite differences and an implementation for the wave equation. Here, we motivate the technique by recalling classic results of Analysis, including the definition of the derivative and Cauchy's generalized mean value theorem. In addition, we also discuss the importance of the CFL condition when ensuring convergence of a finite differences program. Our statement of CFL is as defined by Courant, Friedrichs and Lewy, and our discussion of CFL is motivated by texts from Lui. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following finite differences, we discuss the Fourier Spectral method, and outline both the underlying mathematics and implementation. We start with a general discussion of other common numerical techniques, including spectral methods, as defined in texts from Süli. Next, a discussion of the continuous Fourier transform as it relates to the wave equation, in which we appeal to ODE techniques. After a discussion of the discrete Fourier transfrom and the FFT, which follows the logic of texts from Sauer, we end with a brief overview of an implementation of a Fourier spectral method for the wave equation. \n",

    "### 1  The Wave Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The wave equation is a second order partial differential equation which describes both traveling and standing waves as they occur in classical physics. The equation is particularly useful in modeling mechanical waves, such as sound waves, or electromagnetic waves, such as light waves. Note that the wave equation is not the same as the wave function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be some $n$-dimensional vector $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots x_n)$, and suppose that $u(x,t)$ describes the displacement of a system from an initial rest position. The wave equation will describe the acceleration of this displacement over time. Specifically, the scalar form of the wave equation is\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we recall the definition of the derivative. Suppose some function $f: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ where $a \\in E$ is a limit point of $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if the following limit exists: \n",
    "\n",

    "    lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} &= \\frac{f(a)-f(a - h)}{h} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the difference quotient in either of these forms will be useful in proving the difference quotient for the second derivative of a function. To make our definition above more concise, it is also useful to recall that if $a \\in E$ is a limit point, then: \n",
    "\n",

    "    \\forall \\epsilon > 0: \\exists x \\in E: 0 < |x - a| < \\epsilon \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, $E$ contains points which are arbitrarily close but not equal to $a$. This definition is the foundation of the finite differences approach. By manipulating the difference quotient, we can build a technique to approximte solutions to any ODE or PDE of any order. It is possible to do this since we can generalize the definition of the difference quotient to higher order derivatives as well. For our purpose, we will need to know the difference quotient for the second derivative of a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Claim:}$ Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable and let $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Further, suppose that $f''(a)$ exists. Then:\n",

    "We can provide two proofs of this fact. The first is quite clear but is also quite an abuse of notation. The second makes use of Cauchy's generalized Mean Value Theorem. \n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting $h = h_1 = h_2$, then we may simplify to get the form stated in the claim, and this concludes the proof. Although this is concise, we cannot interchange the limits, nor is it appropriate to assume that $h = h_1 = h_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To provide our second proof, we first state the Cauchy MVT, without proof. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Cauchy MVT:}$ Let $a < b$ and $f,g: [a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Assume that $f,g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then, there exists $\\xi \\in (a,b)$ such that \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that we must consider $lim_{h \\rightarrow 0^{-}}$ separately. Here we only consider the right derivative, and note that the case for the left derivative follows similarly. This concludes the proof. With this, we now have a stong understanding of the definition of the first and second derivative. Now we can use these facts to construct a method for approximating solutions to PDEs. \n",

    "The first step of this process will be to write the PDE using the difference quotient. To make things a bit more intuitive, we will write the limits as $lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}$, $lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}$ and $lim_{\\Delta y \\rightarrow 0}$. Suppose that we let $x = a$, $y = b$ and $t = T$. Then we have:  \n",

    "By inspection, we see that this is quite easy to generalize to the $n$-dimensional case. Although this form is quite cumbersome, we can leverage it to numerically approximate solutions to the wave equation. The key is to ignore the limit, and let $u(a,b,T+\\Delta t)$ be unknown. By doing this, we will be able to approximate solutions for fixed $t$ beyond our initial time $T$. Thus, we get something that looks like this:\n",

Numerical techniques for approximating solutions to such a PDE, including finite differences, will rely on a $\\textbf{discretization}$ of the function space to an finite sequence of probelms.\n",

    "Applying the inverse Fourier transform is as simple as applying the matrix $\\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ to some vector. Since $\\mathcal{F}$ is unitary, then $\\mathcal{F} = \\overline{\\mathcal{F}}^T$. This property is rather useful to exemplify why it is common to normalize both the continuous and discrete Fourier transforms. This matrix-vector product is the foundation of a class of algorithms dedicated to computing a discrete Fourier transform, most notably Fast Fourier Transfrom (FFT) algorithms. For our purpose, the FFT will be useful in implementing a Fourier spectral method.\n",

    "There is a rich history of Fast Fourier Transform algorithms. The most commonly used variation is that of Cooley and Tukey, first described in their 1965 paper. This is a recursive, divide and conquer algorithm, and thus works best for input sizes which are powers of two. However, other variations exist, such as the Good's prime factor FFT, which is efficient for input data of relatively prime size, and makes use of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In fact, Good's work was a first step to inspiring Cooley and Tukey's algorithm. Before either of these implementations, the algorithm was first described, albeit in less detial, by Gauss. Today, most imlementations use the Cooley and Tukey algorithm, or some variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the DFT is a matrix-vector product, a straightforward algorithm to compute would typically be quadratic in the size of the vector which the transform is applied to. However, the Cooley and Tukey algorithm provides an alternative which runs in loglinear time (at worst) by taking advantage of the recursive structure of the DFT. Here, we motivate how and why the FFT works, without explicitly proving it's time complexity.\n",

    "and therefore, the DFT of a real vector will result in a complex vector where half of the information contained is just the complex conjugate of another entry in the vector. Thus, we can break our probelm down recursively, and each computation of a DFT of size $n$ is equivalent to two DFTs of size $n/2$. The FFT will recursively break the problem into DFTs of smaller size until hitting the base case of size $2$. From there, we reconstruct larger solutions using multiplication and addition operations, and finally a division by $\\sqrt{n}$. We do not explicitly include pseudocode for the FFT in this note.\n",

    "To start, let's make the assumption that for the one-dimensional wave equation $u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}$, we may write $u(x,t)$ as a product of functions with respect to $x$ and $t$. More specifically, we have\n",

    "With this assumption, it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption that this constant is of the form $- \\lambda^2$ is rather important. With this, it is quite simple to show that the following are general solutions to $\\phi$ and $\\psi$: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "### 9  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have described in detail how to construct both a finite differences and Fourier spectral approach to approixmate solutions to PDEs. Specifically, we use the wave equation to motivate discussion and implementation of these techniques. Throughout, we have appealed to well known results of Analysis and Fourier Analysis and used tools of linear algebra to provide a solid mathematical foundation to this work. Finally, we have briefly noted implementation level techniques to increase efficincy for finite differences as well as the advantge of spectral methods in providing smooth, polynomial approximations to PDEs. Natural extensions of this work would be a complete implementation of the Fourier Spectral method, as well as discussion and implementations of other techniques, such as FEMs and Finite Volumes. \n",
