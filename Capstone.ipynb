    "# Numerical Techniques for the Wave Equation\n",
    "## Math 437 Capstone Project, Fall 2023\n",
    "### Author: Christian Lentz\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project will be to investigate numerical techniques for approximating solutions to PDEs. We will use finite differences to build a simple model for the wave equation with randomized initial conditions and periodic boundary conditions. We include four implementations of finite differences, including in both one and two spatial dimensions. This will motivate discussions and comparisons of other numerical techniques and thier implementations, particularly the Fourier spectral method. We include one implementation of the Fourier spectral method using the Fast Fourier Transform.\n",

    "### 1  The Wave Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The wave equation is a second order partial differential equation which describes both traveling and standing waves as they occur in classical physics. The equation is particularly useful in modeling mechanical waves, such as sound waves, or electromagnetic waves, such as light waves. Note that the wave equation is not the same as the wave function, which is used in quantum mechanics to describe the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be some $n$-dimensional vector $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots x_n)$, and suppose that $u(x,t)$ describes the displacement of a system from an initial rest position. The wave equation will describe the acceleration of this displacement over time. Specifically, the scalar form of the wave equation is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} &= c^2 (\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_{1}^2} + \\dots + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_{n}^2})\n",
    "\\end{align*}, \n",

    "This form of the wave equation which we use assumes no friction. For this project, we will use finite difference and spectral methods to approximate solutions to the wave equation with periodic boundary conditons in order to investigate and compre the underlying numerical techniques. Throghout, we discuss useful modeling applications.   \n",

    "### 2  Finite Differences\n",

    "The finite differences method makes use of the definition of the derivative, or the difference quotient. However, rather than taking the limit, we will approximate solutions to the PDE at finitely many fixed points in time, hence why we call this finite differences. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1  A bit of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we recall the definition of the derivative. Suppose some function $f: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ where $x_{0} \\in E$ is a limit point of $E \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$ if the following limit exists: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} &= \\frac{f(x_0 + x)-f(x_0)}{x} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, we may also write the difference quotient as: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} &= \\frac{f(x_0)-f(x_0 - x)}{x} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the difference quotient in either of these forms will be useful in proving the difference quotient for the second derivative of a function. To make our definition above more concise, it is also useful to recall that if $x_0 \\in E$ is a limit point, then: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\forall \\epsilon > 0: \\exists x \\in E: 0 < |x - x_0| < \\epsilon \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, $E$ contains points which are arbitrarily close but not equal to $x_0$. This definition is the foundation of the finite differences approach. By manipulating the difference quotient, we can build a technique to approximte solutions to any ODE or PDE of any order. It is possible to do this since we can generalize the definition of the difference quotient to higher order derivatives as well. For our purpose, we will need to know the difference quotient for the second derivative of a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Claim:}$ Let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable and let $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Further, suppose that $f''(x_0)$ exists. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    f''(x_0) &= lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x_0 + x) + f(x_0 - x) - 2f(x_0)}{x^2}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can provide two proofs of this fact. The first is quite clear but is also quite and abuse of notation. The second makes use of the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{Proof 1:}$ Since $f''(x_0)$ exists, it follows that: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    f''(x_0) &= lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f'(x_0 + x) - f'(x_0)}{x} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, since $f$ is a differentiable function, then we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    f''(x_0) &= lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\frac{f(x_0 + x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1} - \\frac{f(x_0) - f(x_0 - x_2)}{x_2}}{x} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting $x = x_1 = x_2$, then we may simplify to get the form stated in the claim, and this concludes the proof. \n",

    "#### 2.2  Finite Differences for the Wave Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the difference quotient for the first and second derivative of a function, we can use these facts to build a method for approximating solutions to first or second order PDEs. Here, we outline our technique for the wave equation, and in the following sections we inclulde an example of finite differences code for an advection-diffusion PDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the wave equation in two spatial dimensions $x$ and $y$: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} &= c^2 (\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2})\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of this process will be to write the PDE using the difference quotient. To make things a bit more intuitive, we will write the limits as $lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}$, $lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0}$ and $lim_{\\Delta y \\rightarrow 0}$. Suppose that we let $x = a$, $y = b$ and $t = T$. Then we have:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{u(a, b, T + \\Delta t) + u(a, b, T - \\Delta t) - 2u(a, b, T)}{(\\Delta t)^2} = \\dots\\\\\n",
    "    \\dots = c^2(lim_{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{u(a + \\Delta x, b, T) + u(a - \\Delta x, b, T) - 2u(a, b, T)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\dots \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "By inspection, we see that this is quite easy to generalize to the $n$-dimensional case. Although this form is quite cumbersome, we can leverage it to numerically approximate solutions to the wave equation. The key is to ignore the limit, and let $u(a,b,T+\\Delta t)$ be unknown. By doing this, we will be able to approximate solutions for fixed $t$ beyond our initial time $T$. Thus, we get something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    u(a, b, T + \\Delta t) \\approx \\dots \\\\\n",
    "    \\dots \\approx 2u(a,b,T) - u(a, b, T - \\Delta t) + \\dots \\\\ \n",
    "    \\dots + \\frac{c^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{(\\Delta x)^2} (u(a + \\Delta x, b, T) + u(a - \\Delta x, b, T) - 2u(a, b, T)) + \\dots \\\\ \n",
    "    \\dots + \\frac{c^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{(\\Delta y)^2} (u(a, b + \\Delta y, T) + u(a, b - \\Delta y, T) - 2u(a, b, T)) \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this equation, we can approximate solutions for our PDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3  Choosing $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta t$\n",
    "\n",
    "We must take care when chooisng parameter values for $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta t$ to assure the stability of our program. In certain cases, a poor choice for these parameters will result in our program producing incorrect solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our wave PDE with solutions of the form $u(x, y, t)$ where $x,y \\in R$ and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{>0}$. Such a PDE can be thought of as an uncountably infinite function space, where at each $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{>0}$ we have a unique function describing a solution to the PDE. Numerical techniques for approximating solutions to such a PDE, including finite differences, will rely on a $\\textbf{discretization}$ of this infinite-dimensional function space to an sequence of finite-dimensional probelms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to model our PDE over the time interval T = $[t_0, t_{max}]$. A discretization of the time variable will split this iterval into finitely many points by choosing some $\\Delta t$. The cardinality of this disretized set is: \n",
    "\n",

    "    N = \\frac{t_{max} - t_0}{\\Delta t} \n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we have transformed the uncountably infinite interval $T$ into a finite sequence of $N$ probelms, where we approximate a solution to the PDE for each $t \\in dT$. We can easily generalize this to the case where we wish to model the PDE for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{>0}$ by simply letting $t_0 = 0$ and $t_{max} = \\infty$. In this case, $dT$ is a countably infinite set. However, we must also place a discretization on the spatial variables as well. Thus, we must also choose some $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ in order to transform the space into a discretized grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, we must choose these parameters such that $\\Delta t$ is not too large as too allow the wave to travel to another coordinate in the grid within that interval of time. We can ensure proper selection of these parameters by adhering to the $\\textbf{CFL condition}$, which is commonly used with finite differences to model advection like processes. The condition states that for a PDE with spatial variables $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ and temporal variable $t$, a discretization of these parameters must satisfy that \n",

    "It is worth noting other common classes of numerical techniques, including Finite Element Methods (FEMs) and Finite Volume Methods. FEMs and Finite Elements both provide continuous or discontinuous piecewise approximations over a tesselation of the domain. While they are more similar to Finite Differences than Spectral Methods, they are considerably more difficult mathematically when compared to finite differences, and are also more difficult to implement. However, $\\textbf{Spectral Methods}$ can deliver highly accurate, $\\textbf{smooth}$ approximations for a solution to a PDE.  \n",

    "#### 5.1 Spectral Methods: A Brief Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral methods approximate solutions to PDEs in the form of fixed degree polynomials, which are $\\textbf{smooth}$ by definiton. Recall that for some open set $U$, any function $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is said to belong to the $\\textbf{differentiability class } C^n$ iff each higher-order derivative of $f$ in the set $\\{f^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ exists and is continuous over $U$. A smooth function belongs to the class $C^{\\infty}$, or is $\\textbf{infinitely differentiable}$. If the underlying PDE is a smooth function, then a spectral method can provide a highly accurate approximation. \n",

First, we examine the wave equation using these techniques, and use this to show that we can construct a spectral method using the $\\textbf{Fourier Transform}$. \n",
